# First Create the database
CREATE DATABASE conference;

# Connect to the database, so that our tables, etc., will be there
\c conference

# When you run these commands at Heroku, you won't need (or be able to) create
# your own separate database first. It will already be created and you will
# be connected to it.

# A few helpful commands you might want during the process:
# \dt - Lists the tables
# \d+ public.user - Shows the details of the user table
# DROP TABLE public.user - Removes the user table completely so we can re-create it
# \q - Quit the application and go back to the regular command prompt
